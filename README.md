# Advent of Code 2023 in Perl

## !!! DISCLAIMER !!!
I have never used Perl before and it's been a while since I have done some programming challenges. 
I will try to exploit language's functionalities as much as possible.

## Usage

To run a (valid) day `n` use

```bash
perl run.pl n
```

## Fish trick

As I use `fish` I set the following alias

```
alias --save advent_of_code "perl run.pl"
```

so that running a valid day `n` is

```
advent_of_code n
```
